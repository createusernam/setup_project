# Visualization Guide — human-track views at pipeline decision points

Where the **human** sees what the AI is about to do, at the gates of `docs/human/PIPELINE.md`. This is the **human track** — the **agent** documentation track is separate (GRACE: in-code, not human-read; see `AGENTS.md`, `skills/grace-ontology/SKILL.md`). The two coexist and **do not render into each other**.

## Why (the risk this closes)

A plan can be internally consistent while omitting a requirement or adding an assumption. A compact
visual gives the human a reviewable view of scope, structure and dependencies before work is turned
into tickets. Mermaid is the default portable format, not a mandatory design method.

---

## Three rules

### Rule 1 — Write the viewpoint contract before notation

Start with the stakeholder decision, then choose concern and scale, and only then select notation.
For every durable gate view, write `docs/views/<view-id>.json` and validate it against
`viewpoint.schema.json` before rendering:

```json
{
  "$schema": "../../viewpoint.schema.json",
  "version": "1",
  "view_id": "story-payment-capacity",
  "stakeholder": "operations_manager",
  "decision": "where to add capacity before peak load",
  "story_ref": "US-17",
  "concern": "flow_and_overflow",
  "scale": "system",
  "focal_elements": ["incoming_orders", "processing_bucket", "overflow_queue"],
  "actors": ["operations_manager"],
  "metaphor": {
    "name": "buckets_and_overflow",
    "mapping": {"bucket": "worker_pool_capacity", "liquid": "queued_work", "spill": "rejected_or_delayed_work"},
    "limits": ["liquid is homogeneous; real requests are not"]
  },
  "canonical_refs": ["contract.json#/integrations"],
  "hidden_aggregation": ["request priority and service-time variance"],
  "next_scale_views": ["story-payment-capacity-worker"],
  "approval": {"status": "draft", "by": null, "at": null}
}
```

The machine-readable order is:

1. **Stakeholder + decision** — whose question, what decision, and which story/evidence anchors it?
2. **Concern** — `structural | behavioral | functional | data | goal | flow_and_overflow | dynamics`.
3. **Scale** — `context | system | subsystem | operation`. **One diagram = one altitude**.
4. **Projection** — actors and optional metaphor with explicit mapping, limits, and hidden aggregation.
5. **Notation** — only now pick the diagram language that encodes the concern and scale.

Keep approximately 1–3 focal elements where that makes the decision easier to read. More than three
is valid only when the view records an aggregation rationale or a reason not to split it; this is a
reviewable readability heuristic, not a schema cap or a cognitive-science standard. A metaphor is a
human projection, never canonical ontology; process/structure truth remains in the canonical refs.

### Rule 2 — The plan owner supplies the view before tickets

- **Who:** the person or agent responsible for the plan owns the view; a separate reviewer approves it.
- **When:** the view lands before work is committed to issues/build.
- **How:** save each view in a stably named Markdown file next to the state artifact.

### Rule 3 — Format by audience

| Format | Audience | Where viewed | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| **JSON** | agent | state files | `contract.json`, `handoff.json` — keep agent-native, don't prettify |
| **Mermaid-in-Markdown** | human | any compatible Markdown renderer | primary portable gate format |
| **HTML** | human | **normal browser** | rich standalone review only. HTML is richer for viz and loads Mermaid via `<script src=".../mermaid@11/…min.js">` — in a browser the CDN works fine (**not** a claude.ai Artifact → no CSP block, no SVG pre-render). Colors inherit from `design-contract.json` `design_tokens.values.*` when present at project root, so Mermaid diagrams use the project's accent and near-black text. |

Switch: **≤2 diagrams → Markdown; ≥3 or needs interactivity → HTML.**

## Gate → view map

The concrete deliverable — for each human decision point in `docs/human/PIPELINE.md`, the concern drives cut → scale → notation:

| Gate | Human's concern | Cut | Scale | Notation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **-1 Discovery / PM** (`product_brief.md`) | are outcomes, users, scope and evidence status clear | goal | context | `mindmap` (goal tree); optional CLD when feedback dynamics matter |
| **2 + 2-PM** (`task_plan.md` / PBS) | does architecture trace to journeys/criteria; are risks visible | structural + behavioral | modules + end-to-end behavior | `mindmap` (PBS) + activity diagram/equivalent swimlane `flowchart` + module dependency `flowchart` |
| **3 Design HARD STOP** (wireframe) | does the UI match intent | structural + behavioral | components | wireframe (not Mermaid) + `stateDiagram-v2` (flows) |
| **4 + judge** (`contract.json` user_flow) | is "done" defined correctly | behavioral | scenario | `stateDiagram-v2` (step→expect = guarded transition, matches Playwright replay) + `journey` |
| **4b→5 "viz before tickets"** *(new gate)* | **what will the AI build, before issues** | structural + behavioral | modules | `flowchart` (module/dependency) + `kanban`/`flowchart` (issue breakdown, "blocked-by") |
| **7 Verify / review** | what did it *actually* build | structural | modules | `flowchart` from `knowledge-graph.xml` `<depends>` (or a **stack-native** dep tool — TypeDoc/Madge, **not** Doxygen — if a code-derived graph is ever needed) |

---

## The palette — reach past the usual 2-3

Mermaid offers several diagram types. Choose the smallest type that directly answers the review concern:

| Cut | Answers | Mermaid types |
|---|---|---|
| **Structural** | what exists, how connected | `flowchart` · `C4Context` · `architecture-beta` · `block-beta` · `classDiagram` · `erDiagram` · `mindmap` · `treeview-beta` |
| **Behavioral** | what after what, by trigger | `sequenceDiagram` · `stateDiagram-v2` · `journey` · `gitGraph` · `timeline` |
| **Functional / flow** | inputs→outputs, volumes | `flowchart` · `sankey-beta` |
| **Data** | how data is structured | `erDiagram` · `classDiagram` |
| **Goal / motivational** | why it exists, priorities | `mindmap` (goal tree) · `quadrantChart` · `requirementDiagram` · `radar-beta` · **CLD (no native type)** |
| **Quantitative / status** | shares, dates, board | `pie` · `xychart-beta` · `gantt` · `kanban` |

Bonus mappings to setup skills: `ishikawa-beta` (fishbone) → `/diagnose` cause analysis · `wardley-beta` → strategy · `packet-beta`/`zenuml`/`venn-beta` → niche.

### Behavior stack and readability budget

For software behavior, use the smallest projection that answers the current question:

1. end-to-end branches → UML activity view or an equivalent Mermaid flowchart with labelled
   swimlanes;
2. one actor goal → textual use case from `docs/behavior/use-case-template.md`;
3. one message-order hotspot → local `sequenceDiagram` linked to a numbered use-case step;
4. evaluator replay → `contract.json` actions, expects, errors, and trace anchors.

The textual use case is canonical; a diagram is a human-review projection. One diagram keeps one
concern and one altitude. Prefer 12–15 meaningful nodes. More than 20 nodes, more than 7 lifelines,
or nesting deeper than 3 means `SPLIT_REQUIRED` unless the owner records why the view remains
reviewable. This is an operational review budget, not a claim about the UML standard.

---

## The systems-dynamics gap (goal / dynamics cut)

Mermaid has no native type for causal-loop polarity (`+`/`−` edges and reinforcing/balancing
loops). When those dynamics materially affect a decision, use Graphviz DOT with signed edges or a
documented inline-SVG convention. Do not use causal-loop notation for an ordinary structural or
behavioral review.

## Behavior Pack — readable behavior before tickets

Use this mode for every T3/T4 route and for T2 when the project records
`behavior_pack_required=true`: multiple actors or an external service, asynchronous state or
retry/idempotency, a criterion-critical recovery path, or high interaction density/fidelity/cost of
error are sufficient reasons. Do not make a pack for T0/T1 or a simple one-boundary T2 change.

Build: a `flow-<id>.md` overview → one numbered `uc-<id>.md` per actor goal → an interaction file
only for a named `UC-ID/step-N` message-order question → `behavior-index.json` with links,
contract paths, risk-probe evidence, and coverage. Run
`python3 <visualization-skill-root>/scripts/check-behavior-pack.py --project .` before presenting
`SUPERVISION.md` for `viz_before_tickets`.

| Review question | Default artifact | Escalate only when |
|---|---|---|
| What happens from trigger to outcome? | flow/activity swimlane | one actor promise needs precision |
| What does the system promise one actor? | textual use case | message order is genuinely unclear |
| Who sends what, in which order? | local sequence | it is one named UC step |
| Can the promise be replayed? | `contract.json` path | behavior has been resolved |

The index is canonical for traceability; diagrams stay readable projections. A sequence diagram
never exists merely for completeness. The checker fails unresolved critical coverage, a critical UC
without a contract path, broken links, or an over-budget interaction without a `SPLIT_REQUIRED`
justification.

## Obsidian supervision (no plugin)

- Each gate writes a **stably-named `*.md`** (not only inline JSON) with a ` ```mermaid ` block.
- One **`SUPERVISION.md`** index per project links the human-review artifacts.
- During Phase 4c, include the stable link `[Current iteration dashboard](dashboard.md)`. Phase 6
  replaces only the generated `dashboard.md` projection and archives the same view under
  `iterations/<issue-id>/dashboard.md`; it never rewrites the attested upstream supervision index.
- Index each durable view as `story → concern → scale → view → decision → approval` and link both
  its viewpoint JSON and rendered Markdown/HTML projection.
- When a Behavior Pack is required, link its `flow → UC → interaction → contract` map from the
  Phase 4c section before approval.
- A **`.pipeline-state.json`** convention (current phase · last gate · open questions) lets Obsidian show "where the agent is" at a glance.

### Phase 6 iteration dashboard

Run `python3 <visualization-skill-root>/scripts/render-iteration-dashboard.py --project .` after trusted
budget, scaffold-integrity, review-chain, and build-evidence artifacts exist. It produces canonical
`iteration-dashboard.json`, validates an operation-scale dynamics viewpoint at
`docs/views/iteration-<issue-id>.json`, and deterministically renders `dashboard.md` plus the iteration
archive. Status and legal next action come only from trusted artifacts; worker explanation and
uncertainty remain visibly untrusted text. Use `--check` at the Phase 6 exit.

---

## HTML / Mermaid styling (design system integration)

When generating HTML for Mermaid gate reviews, pull the visual identity from
`design-contract.json` at the project root:

- `design_tokens.values.ink` → body text, axis labels, node text
- `design_tokens.values.accent` → flowchart boxes, state borders, journey scoring
- `design_tokens.values.accent2` → secondary lines, link arrows
- `design_tokens.values.warm_bg` → stateDiagram background fill

Inline CSS in the `<style>` block of the generated HTML — no external deps.
If `design-contract.json` is absent, fall back to the house defaults
(ink `#1c1c1c`, accent `#9a3b2f`, accent2 `#d98b6a`, warm_bg `#f6f1ee`).

## Anti-patterns

| ❌ | ✅ |
|---|---|
| Tool-first ("we have tool X — draw whatever it emits") | Concern first, then scale, then notation |
| Notation chosen before the stakeholder's question | Name the decision, then derive the view |
| Two scales on one diagram (service next to a single function) | One altitude per diagram |
| Executor draws the human view | Architect draws it; executor stays on the GRACE track |
| Visualize after tickets are cut | Visualize the plan **before** tickets |
| `flowchart`+`sequence` for everything | Pick the type that fits the cut (goal→`mindmap`/CLD, status→`kanban`, …) |
| One sequence diagram for the whole user journey | Activity/flow overview → textual use cases → local sequences only where message order matters |
